# Glee - A dedicated locale editor for Godot

Glee is a simple tool for making localizations of your games. You can either tell it where the Godot project folder is located, or just open the .CSV 

I wrote this little tool because not everyone who translates games wants to have a copy of the entire game just to do so.
